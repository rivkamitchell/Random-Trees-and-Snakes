# Random Trees and Snakes

This notebook contains simulations pertaining to random trees and random walks on random trees. 

- The file B-ary Random Trees simulates the distribution of the cover time of a random walk on a b-ary tree with n generations. 

- The file Snake_Plots simulates examples of globally centred discrete snakes on size-conditionned Poisson(1) Bienaym√© trees. An example being:
